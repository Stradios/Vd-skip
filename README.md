# Vd-skip - WoW 3.3.5a Dialogue Skipping Addon

**Streamline vendor, flight master, and trainer interactions — while preserving important quest dialogues.**

## 📝 Description

**Vd-skip** is a lightweight World of Warcraft (3.3.5a) addon that automatically skips unnecessary NPC dialogue interactions for vendors, flight masters, and profession trainers — while intelligently preserving quest interactions when they exist.

Inspired by modern WoW’s streamlined interface, Vd-skip brings quality-of-life improvements to Wrath of the Lich King clients by:

- Instantly opening vendor windows  
- Immediately opening flight maps  
- Directly showing profession trainer skills  
- Preserving quest interactions when NPCs have quests available
