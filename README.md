- Instantly opening **vendor** windows if no quests are present
- Immediately showing the **flight map** if the NPC has no quests
- Automatically skipping **empty quest greetings**
- Respecting quest availability ‚Äî never skips when quests are offered or active
- Providing **slash commands** to toggle features on the fly
